            <p>The University is a confederation of schools, faculties, departments and Colleges. The Colleges are governed by their own statutes and regulations, but are integral to the make-up of the University of Cambridge. The University of Cambridge is an exempt charity subject to regulation by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) under the UK Charities Act 2006.

            <p>For 800 years, the world has invested in Cambridge and Cambridge has delivered. We gave you gravity, evolution, computers and pulsars. Next we could deliver clean energy sources, longer lives, quantum computers and parallel universes. But first we need to ask more from the world.</p>
